### Hi there 👋

I’ve been maintaining your favorite Range Slider library for more than 10 years. Please check [Ion.RangeSlider repo](https://github.com/IonDen/ion.rangeSlider)

This lib is a result of a hard work for many years. Currently version 3.0 based on TypeScript with 0 dependencies is under developement.
